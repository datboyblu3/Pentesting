## What is Active Directory

Active Directory is a collection of machines and servers connected inside of domains, that are part of a forest of domains, which make up the Active Directory network.

## Why use Active Directory?
  * Control user computers/devices via a single domain controller
  * Allows for SSO
  * Access stored files and folders in the server as well as local storage

There are 5 key structural components that make up Active Directory: 
  * domains
  * tree
  * forest
  * organizational unit
  * site

#### Domains 
Used to communicate with client computers and applications that do not use DNS to find domain services, such as domain controllers, but use NetBIOS. Windows 95, 98 and NT rely on NetBIOS

#### DNS domain name
  * Kerberos support is needed to use the DNS domain name for authentication to     Active Directory
  * Acts as a policy and replication boundary for policy-based security settings inlcuding Account Policy, Group Policy Objects and replication

#### Account Policy
  * Includes control over passwords, account lockout and Kerberos authentication. Meaning that domain user accounts can't be controlled at the organizational unit level; they must be controlled at the domain level
  * Account Policy is not inherited from the parent domain

#### Group Policy Objects
  * Responsible for pushing security to computers in the domain
  * GPOs within the domain cannot span multiple domains by inheritance or hierarchy
  * The above does not mean they aren't available to other domains

#### Replication boundary for the domain naming context
Split into four contexts:
  Domain Name: 
        * Responsible for user, group, computer accounts.
        * When domain controllers replicate to exchange and synchronize the changes from other domain controllers, the domain naming context is synchronized with only domain controllers in the same domain. This provides security in that user accounts that are configured in one domain don't have access to resources in other domains until an administrator configures that access
        
#### Trees
These are collections of domains within an AD network that share a common schema and configuration. Domains in a tree are also linked together by trust relationships, making AD a set of one or more trees

Trees can be viewed as the trust relationships bewteen domains or the namespace of the domain tree

#### Forests
A forest contains at least one Active Directory tree. It is the top most logical container in an AD configuration that contains domains, users, computers and group policies. The forest structure is determined at the installation of the first domain controller for a new domain. AD forests can be used to isolate AD trees with specific data and give autonomy to the user to interact with the data.

A single AD configuration can contain multiple domains, the tier above the domains is the AD forest. Under each domain, are several trees.

Since nothing is shared between forests - not the schema, GPOs or administration, the forest is seen as the true security boundary among AD structural components. However functions such as, Global catalog, schema, configuration context can have forestwide effects.

**Advantages**
* The forest acts as a centralized mechanism for managing and controlling authentication and authorization across the organization. Admins can create user objects within the AD. These user objects act as security principals, meaning AD can authenticate logins
* Group policy enforces user account or computer configurations
* Creation of security groups linked to access control lists associated with folders and other resources, granting permissions to group members

**Disadvantages**
* Not secure by default because it still requires setup for permissions and authentication for each forest
* Multi-forest designs also increase costs. It's recommended to consolidate AD forests as much as possible to reduce cost

##### Global Catalog

##### Schema

##### Configuration Context

#### Organizational Units
These are objects within a domain that help organizat the other objects within the domain. They cannot be shared amongst multiple domains, but they can be configured in a hiearchy within the domain.
