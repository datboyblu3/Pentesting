## What is Active Directory

Active Directory is a collection of machines and servers connected inside of domains, that are part of a forest of domains, which make up the Active Directory network.

## Why use Active Directory?
  * Control user computers/devices via a single domain controller
  * Allows for SSO
  * Access stored files and folders in the server as well as local storage

There are 5 key structural components that make up Active Directory: 
  * domains
  * tree
  * forest
  * organizational unit
  * site

#### Domains 
Used to communicate with client computers and applicatins that do not use DNS to find domain services, such as domain controllers, but use NetBIOS. Windows 95, 98 and NT rely on NetBIOS

#### DNS domain name
  * Kerberos support is needed to use the DNS domain name for authentication to     Active Directory
  * Acts as a policy and replication boundary for policy-based security settings inlcuding Account Policy, Group Policy Objects and replication

#### Account Policy

#### Group Policy Objects

#### Replication boundary for the domain naming context
