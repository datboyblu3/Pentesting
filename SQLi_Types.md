#### In-Band SQLi
--------------------

* Refers to the same method of communication being used to exploit the vulnerability and also receive the results, for example, 
 discovering an SQL Injection vulnerability on a website page and then being able to extract data from the database to the same page.
 
 *Examples:*

```Javascript
```

#### Error-Based SQL Injection
--------------------------------
* Most useful for easily obtaining information about the database structure as error messages from the database are printed directly to the browser screen. 
* This can often be used to enumerate a whole database.

*Examples:*

```Javascript
```

##### Union-Based SQL Injection
---------------------------------
*  Utilises the SQL UNION operator alongside a SELECT statement to return additional results to the page. This method is the most common way of extracting large 
* amounts of data via an SQL Injection vulnerability.

*Examples:*

```Javascript
```

##### Time-Based SQL Injection
-------------------------------
* A time-based blind SQL Injection is very similar to the above Boolean based, in that the same requests are sent, but there is no visual indicator of your queries being wrong or right this time. 
* Instead, your indicator of a correct query is based on the time the query takes to complete. 
* This time delay is introduced by using built-in methods such as SLEEP(x) alongside the UNION statement. 
* The SLEEP() method will only ever get executed upon a successful UNION SELECT statement.

*Examples: Establishing the number of columns in a table, if no pause, the query was unsuccessful*

```Javascript
admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5);--
```

*Examples: This payload should have produced a 5-second time delay, which confirms the successful execution of the UNION statement and that there are two columns.*
```Javascript
admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2;--
```

```Javascript
referrer=admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2  FROM information_schema.COLUMNS WHERE table_schema = 'sqli_four' and table_name ='analytic' and COLUMN_NAME like 'a%';--
```
