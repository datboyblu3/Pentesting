#### In-Band SQLi
--------------------

* Refers to the same method of communication being used to exploit the vulnerability and also receive the results, for example, 
 discovering an SQL Injection vulnerability on a website page and then being able to extract data from the database to the same page.

#### Error-Based SQL Injection
--------------------------------
* Most useful for easily obtaining information about the database structure as error messages from the database are printed directly to the browser screen. 
* This can often be used to enumerate a whole database.

##### Union-Based SQL Injection
---------------------------------
*  Utilises the SQL UNION operator alongside a SELECT statement to return additional results to the page. This method is the most common way of extracting large 
* amounts of data via an SQL Injection vulnerability.
